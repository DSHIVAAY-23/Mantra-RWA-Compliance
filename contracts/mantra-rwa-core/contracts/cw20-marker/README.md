# Marker Contract

## Requirements

1. Maximum supply cap for token
2. Maximum holder balance
3. Frozen token balance (each account will have a frozen balance) (eg. If a users frozen balance is 100, but the user has 1000 tokens total, he/she will only be able to transfer or trade 900 of them)
4. Authorized countries (will be denoted as country code, ie. 91 will be India)
5. The ability to freeze entire accounts (unable to trade or transfer)
6. Anyone that receives or holds the token will become a share holder (this can be through a trade as well). If a user balance goes to 0, then we will remove that person from the shareholders data structure or mapping.
