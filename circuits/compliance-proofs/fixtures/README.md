# Cached Proof Fixtures

This directory contains pre-generated ZK proofs for demo purposes.

## Purpose

Grant reviewers can run the demo instantly without waiting 10-30 minutes for Groth16 proof generation.

## Files

- `proof_output.json` - Pre-computed SP1 Groth16 proof with metadata
- `README.md` - This file

## Usage

The demo script (`scripts/run_demo_flow.sh`) uses cached proofs by default:

```bash
# Fast demo (uses cached proof)
./scripts/run_demo_flow.sh

# Full generation (30 minutes)
./scripts/run_demo_flow.sh --generate
```

## Proof Details

The cached proof was generated using:
- **Proof System**: SP1 Groth16
- **Curve**: BN254
- **Guest Program**: 151KB RISC-V ELF
- **Input**: 384-dimensional document embeddings
- **Computation**: Fixed-point cosine similarity verification

## Authenticity

This is a **real cryptographic proof** generated by the SP1 zkVM, not a mock.
It can be verified on-chain via the CosmWasm verifier contract.

## Regeneration

To regenerate the cached proof:

```bash
cd circuits/compliance-proofs/crates/mantra-script
cargo run --release --bin mantra
cp ../../../../proof_output.json ../../fixtures/
```
