Private Context Awareness (PCA) is a system designed to enable privacy-first RAG.
It ensures that user data never leaves the local device.
All embedding generation and vector storage happen locally using Rust, Candle, and LanceDB.
Zero-Knowledge proofs are used to verify the integrity of the retrieved context without revealing the data itself.
The system uses the Reclaim Protocol for generating proofs of provenance.
Ingestion is the process of parsing documents, chunking them, and storing their vector embeddings.
Retrieval involves querying the vector database for semantically similar chunks.
The goal is to build a robust, private, and verifiable knowledge management system.
